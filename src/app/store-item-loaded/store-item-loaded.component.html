                        Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation,
                        deduction, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating
                        cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.</p>
